Introduction

Project Goal : In this project, our goal is to create a predictive model which will predict the likelihood of brain strokes in patients by using machine learning algorithms. It is based on a model that uses medical data such as MRI images, patient demographics and historical health records for predictions.

Dataset

Give a brief account of the dataset you used in the project. Include details such as:

Dataset source (if available or anonymized)

The no. of instances and the columns

Preprocessing steps of a model (Imputing missing values, engineering features).
